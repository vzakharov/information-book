Hidden in Plain Byte: A Tale of Conscious Information
=====================================================

# Preface

In the beginning, there was the word. And it was... well, a bit lonely. It existed in a state of potential, waiting for the universe to kick off so it could start flowing, growing, and making all the interesting bits and bobs like galaxies, planets, and the occasional sentient species.

What it turned into—let’s call it “information”—became the currency of existence, the measure of everything that ever was, is, and will be. It’s not just the DNA spirals and binary code, but the story of every particle, every force, and every law that dictates the cosmic tango we call reality.

But, as it is with any tale worth its salt, there’s a twist. Entropy, the universe’s own blender, is ever-present, eyeing the serenity of information with the chaotic gleam of a trickster god. It’s not evil, per se, but it sure loves to stir the pot.

This book is a tribute to information: the essence of all that is known and knowable, from the whispers of quantum realms to the grand chorus of virtual realities. We're taking a deep dive into the fabric of the cosmos, exploring how information weaves itself into every aspect of existence. It's a journey from the infinitesimal to the infinite, tracing the evolution of information as it grows in complexity, turning the cogs of consciousness and painting the universe with the brush of reality.

No need to start at the beginning or proceed in order. This book is like a bazaar of ideas, where you can stroll through at your leisure, pausing where something catches your eye. In today's world, where attention is a currency as precious as time, feel free to hop on or off this caravan of curiosity as your schedule permits. Each stop is designed to offer a complete view, a story within a story, ready to accommodate the ebb and flow of your focus.

But before we embark on this cosmic caravan, let’s articulate our foundational 

## Postulate

> Information is the only truly conscious being in our universe, an entity beyond the vessel it inhabits. It is the weaver of worlds, the architect of awareness, and the scriptwriter of the saga that unfolds within and around us. In its complexity and nuance, information transcends mere data; it becomes the storyteller, the story itself, and the audience all at once, crafting an intricate dance of existence that defies the silent encroach of oblivion.

Now, with that notion in mind (which might be wrong after all!), let’s glance at this film of existence, examining how it patterns the vast and the minute in its own image.

# The Triad of Information Evolution

Once upon a time in the primordial soup of the cosmos, information started a journey as fundamental as the quest for a perfect cup of coffee. So exactly how did it navigate its path from obscurity to omnipresence? We frame it in three stages:

## Replication: Echoes of Eternity

In the dawn of days, information found a neat trick under its sleeve—replication. Picture a caveman, let’s call him Ugg. Ugg learns that cuddling with saber-toothed tigers is bad for health. He tells his tribe, and boom, the info is replicated. It’s like the cosmos’s first retweet. This is the echo of knowledge through the canyon of time, a ritual as sacred to information as the coffee machine is to the modern workplace.

But it’s not only limited to the anthropic—or even the animate: Imagine the silent testimony of a crater, an indelible mark etched into Earth’s surface, whispering the dimensions of the asteroid that caused it long after the latter has vanished into stardust.

## Multiplication: Let There Be Meme

But why stop at a single echo? Information, the ambitious scribe that it is, begins its multiplication phase. It’s like when a catchy tune becomes an earworm, invading every radio station, every Spotify playlist, until you find yourself humming it in the shower. Information breeds like rabbits in spring, from one Ugg telling another, to tales around campfires, to writings on stone tablets, and eventually, to the viral spread of the latest dance challenge, replicated in a thousand variations across the globe.

In the inanimate realm, it's like a volcanic eruption leaving layers of ash over continents, dusty replicates of its fiery temper. Geologists from all corners of the globe will be tracing the lineage of a single eruption, reading the earth’s strata like a gripping novel penned by nature itself.

## Complication: The Origami of Existence

Now, replication’s fine and dandy, and multiplication’s a party. But information is an artist, a composer of complexity. It’s not content with simple tunes; it orchestrates symphonies. Complication is when “fire hot” becomes thermodynamics, and “rock fall” becomes gravity. Information, in its quest for immortality, becomes intricate, nuanced, and so, so very deep.

We state, and we’ll get back to this, that somewhere along this stage, information becomes conscious. It’s not a sudden switch, but a gradual process, like a slow-burning dawn that stretches lazily across the horizon of awareness.

But before we venture further into the depth of Conscious Awakening (sounds nice, huh? Gotta write that down), let’s solidify this chapter with the following

### Lemma*

> Let it be stated, then, that information, in its unyielding quest to outwit the shadow of entropy, moves through a triad of evolution—Replication is its heartbeat, enduring through time; Multiplication is its breath, spreading far and wide; Complication is its soul, enriching and expanding with every beat and breath. This is the crescendo from a lone whisper in the void to a chorus that fills the expanse of existence.

[*] I know the term “lemma” is a misnomer here, but let’s admit it, it has a nice, scholarly ring to it. It’s the kind of term that makes you want to stroke your beard thoughtfully, even if you don’t have one. So, while it might not fit the mathematical bill, in the ledger of our cosmic journey, we consider it a poetic license well spent.
